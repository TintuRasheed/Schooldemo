<p>The department of Mathematics established in 1955, has been in the main stream of academic life of Nirmala. The charter members of the teaching faculty of Mathematics were Rev. Dr. Thomas Moothedan (Head of the Department), Mr. George P. Kurian and Mr. Kulathu Iyer.</p>

<p>The first B.Sc. batch came out in flying colours with the Ist Rank. It was a great matter of joy that Mr. P. P. Sebastian of the first batch bagged the first rank in the university examination and brought the laurel of distinction for the college. Ever since the inception, the dept. of Mathematics has been producing consistently 100% pass with first and second ranks in the university examinations many times. One of the outstanding rank among them was the all time record of smt. Gracy Sebastian who secured 1000/1000 marks. She later served as a member of the department of mathematics of Nirmala College. The dept. is genuinely proud of its alumni, most of whom are placed in covetable positions in India and abroad.

The department has always been committed to sustain excellence in its academic pursuits as well as co-curricular activities.</p>
